## Project Title.
   
   US Bikeshare Data


## Date of creation

   23-Feb-2019

## Credits

   Using jupyter note-book to analyze biker share data for 3 cities.
  
   To obtain the output according to project rubric. I used to ask help from our methors. Also, i do google so many times for various pieces of codes    and method from places like pythonforbeginners,stackoverflow,pandas.pydata.org and somtime i use to watch youtube videos to clear my doubts.

## Overview
   
   In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago,       New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive              statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## Software Required
   
   To complete this project, the following software requirements apply:
 
   We should have Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
   A text editor, like Sublime or Atom.
   A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).

## The Datasets
   Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six    (6) columns:

   Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
   End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
   Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
   Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
   End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
   User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
   The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

   Gender
   Birth Year

## File Required
  
   To answer these questions using Python, you will need to write a Python script. To help guide your work in this project, a template with helper       code and comments is provided in a bikeshare.py file, and you will do your scripting in there also. You will need the three city dataset files        too:

   chicago.csv
   new_york_city.csv
   washington.csv


## Statistics Computed
   We will learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project,       we'll write code to provide the following information:

   #1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
 
      most common month
      most common day of week
      most common hour of day

   #2 Popular stations and trip

      most common start station
      most common end station
      most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)
 
   #3 Trip duration

      total travel time
      average travel time

   #4 User info

      counts of each user type
      counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
      earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
